B1.22,4,Biocenosis of supralittoral sands,"Area corresponding to the upper beach which is only humected by the sea during storms; however, certain areas do escape being totally submerged and receive a large amount of spray coming from the surge of the waves further down. 2 sets of phenomena are responsible for the dampness: at surface level, the dampness is caused by the salty spray from the breaking of the waves on the coast which is the main cause of the saltiness of the sand and the dampness of the night air. This humification only affects the top 2 or 3 centimetres and disappears quickly under the action of the sun; at depth, the sand is damp because of the proximity of the fairly unsalty ground water."

These temperatures may be extremely high, reaching 50°C in the summer, and are then lethal for individuals living in the sand. This facies is a relatively particular aspect of ‘wracks’ and corresponds to the washing up of almost exclusively marine phanerogam debris from nearby meadows and beds. These wracks always include a fairly sizeable part of other additional elements of anthropic or natural origin.

B3,2,"Rock cliffs, ledges and shores, including the supralittoral","Rock exposures adjacent to the oceans, their connected seas and associated coastal lagoons, or separated from them by a narrow shoreline. The faces, ledges and caves of sea-cliffs and the expanses of rocky shore are important as reproduction, resting and feeding sites for seabirds, sea-mammals and a few groups of terrestrial birds. Sea-cliffs may also harbour highly distinctive, specialised salt-tolerant vegetation with associated terrestrial fauna."
B3.1,3,Supralittoral rock (lichen or splash zone),"Cliffs and rocks of the supralittoral spray zone, mostly occupied by lichens such as [Caloplaca] spp. and [Verrucaria] spp."
B3.11,4,Lichens or small green algae on supralittoral and littoral fringe rock,"Lichen communities typically form a distinct zone or band in a 'splash' zone on most rocky shores. This splash zone occurs above the main intertidal zone (i.e. that subject to regular covering by the tide) and blends into angiosperm-dominated communities of coastal (terrestrial) habitats at its upper limits. The width of the splash zone varies considerably, depending on the degree of exposure of the shore to wave action. On very exposed coasts the zone is very wide, extending 10s of meters up cliffs, whilst in very sheltered sites it may be only a metre or so high. Several biotopes have been identified. Yellow and grey lichens such as [Xanthoria parietina], [Caloplaca marina], [Caloplaca thallincola] or [Ramalina] sp. dominate the supralittoral rock (B3.111) with the distinctive black band of [Verrucaria maura] occurring below in the littoral fringe (B3.1131, B3.1132). Small green seaweeds can sometimes be found in this splash zone, where localised conditions allow growth in what would otherwise be inhospitable conditions for seaweeds. Such an example is the green seaweed [Prasiola stipitata] which occurs in areas of nitrate enrichment from nearby roosting seabirds (B3.112). The littoral fringe on soft rock can be characterised by the green seaweed [Blidingia minima] (B3.114) while steep and vertical rock influenced by freshwater in the littoral fringe can be dominated by the green seaweeds [Ulothrix flacca], [Urospora penicilliformis] and [Urospora wormskioldii] (B3.115). The winkle [Littorina saxatilis] is one of the few 'marine' species found in this environment.
Situation: This habitat type is found in the littoral fringe and the supralittoral zone on all rocky shores if there is sufficient seawater spray to maintain a viable community."
B3.111,5,Yellow and grey lichens on supralittoral rock,"Vertical to gently sloping bedrock and stable boulders in the supralittoral (or splash zone) of the majority of rocky shores are typically characterised by a diverse maritime community of yellow and grey lichens, such as [Xanthoria parietina], [Caloplaca marina], [Lecanora atra] and [Ramalina] spp. The black lichen [Verrucaria maura] is also present, but usually in lower abundance than in the littoral fringe zone. In wave exposed conditions, where the effects of sea-spray extend further up the shore, the lichens generally form a wide and distinct band. This band then becomes less distinct as wave exposure decreases, and in sheltered locations, cobbles and pebbles may also support the biotope. Pools, damp pits and crevices in the rock are occasionally occupied by winkles such as [Littorina saxatilis] and halacarid mites may also be present.
Situation: This biotope is usually found at the top of the shore, immediately above a zone of the black lichen [V. maura] (B3.1131, B3.1132). Above the band of B3.111, and occasionally in crevices in the rock alongside the lichens, terrestrial plants such as the thrift [Armeria maritima] and other angiosperms often occur. In sheltered areas the transition from B3.111 to B3.1132 is often indistinct and a mixed zone of B3.111 and B3.1132 may occur. In estuaries, this biotope is often restricted to artificial substrata such as sea defences."
B3.112,5,[Prasiola stipitata] on nitrate-enriched supralittoral or littoral fringe rock,"Exposed to moderately exposed bedrock and large boulders in the supralittoral and littoral fringe that receives nitrate enrichment from nearby roosting sea birds and is characterised by a band or patches of the ephemeral tufty green seaweed [Prasiola stipitata] or [Prasiola] spp. This typically grows over the black lichen [Verrucaria maura] in the littoral fringe or yellow and grey lichens in the supralittoral zone. In damp pits and crevices, species such as the winkle [Littorina saxatilis], amphipods and halacarid mites are occasionally found. B3.112 often covers a smaller area than 5m x 5m and care should be taken to notice/record this biotope. The biotope can be associated with artificial substrata such as septic tanks, and in supralittoral areas influenced by sewage seeps or agricultural run-off.
Situation: This biotope is found at the top of rocky shores in the splash zone below colonies of nesting or roosting birds growing. B3.112 may also be found at the entrances to and on the ceilings of littoral caves or in patches on large boulders, where birds may be roosting. It can be found in the B3.111 or B3.1132 zones.
Temporal variation: [P. stipitata] reaches its maximum abundance during the winter months. It generally dies out during the summer in southern Britain, when the biotope reverts to either B3.111 or B3.1132. In the cooler northern areas it may be present all year round."
B3.113,5,[Verrucaria maura] on littoral fringe rock,"Bedrock or stable boulders and cobbles in the littoral fringe which is covered by the black lichen [Verrucaria maura]. This lichen typically covers the entire rock surface giving a distinct black band in the upper littoral fringe. The winkle [Littorina saxatilis] is usually present. Two variants are defined which both occur in a wide range of wave exposures. On exposed shores [V. maura] may occur with sparse barnacles such as [Chthamalus] spp. or [Semibalanus balanoides] and may be covered by a band of ephemeral seaweeds such as [Porphyra umbilicalis] or [Enteromorpha] spp. (B3.1131). Above B3.1131 or on more sheltered shores is a species poor community consisting mainly of [V. maura] and [L. saxatilis] (B3.1132).
Situation: This biotope occurs below the yellow and grey lichen zone (B3.111) and above eulittoral communities of barnacles and fuciod algae.
Temporal variation: Distinct band of red or green ephemeral algae may obscure the black lichen band at certain times of the year."
B3.1131,6,[Verrucaria maura] and sparse barnacles on exposed littoral fringe rock,"The littoral fringe of very exposed to moderately exposed rocky shores with a sparse covering of the barnacles [Semibalanus balanoides] and/or [Chthamalus montagui] over the black lichen [Verrucaria maura]. Winkles [Littorina saxatilis] and [Melarhaphe neritoides] are usually present although [M. neritoides] tends to be found on more exposed shores. The limpet [Patella vulgata] is often present though at a low abundance (Occasional). This biotope can be dominated by ephemeral seaweeds including the red seaweed [Porphyra umbilicalis], the green seaweeds [Enteromorpha] spp. or, particulary in the north, microscopic blue-green algae (Cyanophyceae), which overgrow [V. maura]. The wrack [Pelvetia canaliculata] (Rare) may also be present, becoming increasingly more common with greater shelter (see A1.211). Geographical variation: On northern and eastern shores the barnacle is usually [S. balanoides], which is normally restricted to the lower littoral fringe, with a band of [V. maura] only in the upper littoral fringe. On south-west and western shores the barnacle is usually [C. montagui] which may extend over the whole of the littoral fringe zone.
Situation: B3.1131 is usually found on more exposed coasts below the [V. maura] biotope B3.1132. It is found above the mussel [Mytilus edulis] and barnacles biotope (A1.111) or above the barnacle and [Patella] spp. zone (A1.1121; A1.113). B3.1131 also occurs on vertical faces of moderately exposed shores where the [P]. [canaliculata] biotope (A1.211) usually dominates on non-vertical faces.
Temporal variation: The abundance of [P. umbilicalis] shows considerable seasonal and geographical variation. During warm weather [P. umbilicalis] is often bleached light brown and sticks to the rock as it dries out. On southern shores it may be absent during the summer on all but the most exposed shores, as it dies back leaving a barnacle and lichen dominated community. In the cooler north the [P]. [umbilicalis] covering persists throughout the year. [Porphyra linearis] can also be found in the among the [P. umbilicalis] during the late winter and spring."
B3.1132,6,[Verrucaria maura] on very exposed to very sheltered upper littoral fringe rock,"Upper littoral fringe bedrock, boulders and stable cobbles on very exposed to very sheltered shores which have a blanket covering of the black lichen [Verrucaria maura]. The winkle [Littorina saxatilis] is often present. Due to the nature of this biotope it is species poor, but occasionally a range of species may be present in low abundance. These species include the yellow lichen [Caloplaca marina] and the winkle [Melarhaphe neritoides], the barnacles [Chthamalus montagui] and [Semibalanus balanoides] or the ephemeral seaweeds [Porphyra umbilicalis] and [Enteromorpha] spp. can be present in low abundance (see B3.1131). If one or more of these species is present compare with B3.1131. On northern shores [Littorina saxatilis var. rudis] can dominate along with the occasional presence of the lichens [Verrucaria mucosa] and [Xanthoria parietina]. V. maura can be found overlying stable mud in N. Ireland sea loughs.
Situation: The black lichen zone is normally found below the yellow and grey lichen zone (B3.111). In very sheltered areas there is not always a clear transition from one zone to the next and a mixed zone of B3.111 and B3.1132 is common. The wrack [Pelvetia canaliculata] can occur on these more sheltered shores. With increasing wave exposure the two lichen zones become wider and more distinct, and B3.1132 gives way to a lichen and barnacle dominated community (B3.1131) in the lower littoral fringe.
Temporal variation: In areas with nitrate enrichment [V. maura] can be overgrown by the small green seaweed [Prasiola stipitata] (B3.112) which reaches its maximum abundance during the winter months. It generally dies out during the summer in southern Britain, reverting the biotope to B3.1132."
B3.114,5,[Blidingia] spp. on vertical littoral fringe chalk,"Vertical soft rock in the littoral fringe may be characterised by a band of the green seaweeds [Blidingia minima] and [Blidingia marginata]. Unbranched filamentous green seaweeds, including [Ulothrix flacca] and [Urospora wormskioldii], are found amongst the [Blidingia] spp. The siphonous Xanthophyceae [Vaucheria] spp. can also occur in high abundance in this biotope, where they can form dense mats. During low tide terrestrial fauna such as red mites, insects and centipedes migrate into this zone. More information is needed to improve this description.
Situation: B3.114 is found below the [Verrucaria maura] zone (B3.1132) and above a band of the similar looking green algae [Enteromorpha] spp. (A1.451 and A1.452), where these occur in habitats not influenced by freshwater."
B3.115,5,[Ulothrix flacca] and [Urospora] spp. on freshwater-influenced vertical littoral fringe soft rock,"An assemblage of the small un-branched filamentous green seaweeds [Ulothrix flacca], [Urospora penicilliformis] and [Urospora wormskioldii] at High Water Spring Tide level on steep and vertical rock often influenced by freshwater. The community is also present in areas with freshwater seepage. It is visually recognised as a closely adherent, often shiny, green mat of filamentous growth. Associated species include the green seaweeds [Blidingia minima] and [Enteromorpha prolifera], the barnacle [Semibalanus balanoides] and the limpet [Patella vulgata], but these species are not common. Although this biotope does occur on rock other than chalk, this description has been derived from chalk coast sites. More information is needed to improve this description.
Situation: On chalk coasts this community can include [Enteromorpha] spp. and the transition from B3.115 to A1.451 is often indistinct and a mixed zone of B3.115 and A1.451 can occur.
Temporal variation: This biotope is more easily identifiable from autumn to spring as both [Urospora] spp. and [Bangia atropurpurea] may dry out and disappear during the summer. In late winter the red seaweed [B. atropurpurea] may be predominant and the community then appears as shiny blackish mats of filamentous growth."

D1,2,Raised and blanket bogs,"Peatlands formed by ombrotrophic acid peat, which is (or was while actively growing) capable of growth fed by rainfall rather than by the inflow of water from higher ground in the vicinity."
D1.1,3,Raised bogs,"The mire surface and underlying peat of highly oligotrophic, strongly acidic peatlands with a raised centre from which water drains towards the edges. The peat is composed mainly of sphagnum remains. Raised bogs form on nearly flat ground and derive moisture and nutrients only from rainfall (ombrotrophic). Raised bog complexes (X04) include larger bog pools (C1.46) and a marginal lagg (C1.47), as well as the main mire surface (D1.1), which in actively-growing raised bogs typically comprises a complex of low hummocks, small pools and their associated vegetation. Raised bogs form only in cool climates with high rainfall. They are most widespread in the boreal zone and in the mountains and hills of the nemoral zone; they occur locally in the lowlands of the nemoral zone. They are characteristic of lowlands and hills of northwestern and northern Europe, the adjacent Hercynian ranges, the Jura, the Alps and the Carpathians. Bogs harbour, in addition to sphagna, which are often abundant, a small number of vascular plants such as [Eriophorum vaginatum], [Scirpus cespitosus] ([Trichophorum cespitosum]), [Carex pauciflora], [Carex paupercula], [Ledum palustre], [Vaccinium oxycoccos], [Andromeda polifolia] and [Drosera rotundifolia], and lichens. Animal species are not numerous but those that are adapted to bogs are highly specialised. Among typical invertebrates figure dragonflies ([Leucorrhinia dubia], [Aeshna subarctica], [Aeshna caerulea], [Aeshna juncea], [Somatochlora arctica], [Somatochlora alpestris]), lepidopterans ([Colias palaeno], [Boloria aquilonaris], [Coenonympha tullia], [Vacciniina optilete], [Hypenodes turfosalis], [Eugraphe subrosea]), beetles, ants ([Formica exsecta]), bugs and spiders ([Pardosa sphagnicola], [Glyphesis cottonae]). Most of the species that bogs harbour are rare and their populations fragmented into isolated relictual elements; several are threatened. The remaining intact or nearly intact communities are exceptional."
D1.11,4,"Active, relatively undamaged raised bogs","Undisturbed, or little disturbed, peat-forming bogs, often taking the shape of a convex lens. Such intact or nearly intact systems have become very rare or even exceptional. They are composed of a number of communities, which form and occupy the topological features of the bog. These communities are interrelated and function as a unit (part of complex X04), so that they cannot be regarded as separate subhabitats; their presence and combination, however, characterizes the various types of bogs. The subunits thus contribute to a description of individual bog systems. Vegetation of alliances [Oxycocco-Empetrion hermaphroditi], [Sphagnion medii] and [Sphagnion cuspidati]. Typical species in the herb layer [Eriophorum vaginatum], [Oxycoccus palustris], [Vaccinium] spp.; in the moss layer dominance of genus [Sphagnum] spp., e.g. [Sphagnum cuspidatum], [Sphagnum fallax], [Sphagnum palustre] and [Sphagnum magellanicum] among others."
D1.111,5,"Raised bog hummocks, ridges and lawns","Vegetation of the higher parts of the plateau of Palaearctic bogs and of its drier, marginal slope. Intact, typical, raised bogs of northern, lowland and low montane central and eastern Europe display an alternance of well-marked sphagnum hummocks, colonized or not, especially in their drier upper part, by small shrubs, lower, wetter, flat lawns and wet hollows or schlenken. Sphagnum hummocks with no, or few, shrubs are listed in unit D1.1111, sphagnum hummocks, or parts of them, colonized by shrubs in unit D1.1113, lawns in unit D1.1112. In bogs under strong oceanic influence, in high-altitude bogs, in bogs subjected to minerotrophic influences or anthropogenic degradation, a sparse cover of shrubs or tussock-forming graminoids may become ubiquitous and the distinction between hummock and lawn, or even between hummock, lawn and hollow, blurred, in bogs that are often somewhat intermediate towards blanket bogs. Such communities are listed in units D1.1114 to D1.1116, as well as in D1.114 and in D1.121; in some of them sphagna may be scarce or replaced by bryopsid mosses. Well-defined sphagnum hummocks of unit D1.1111 may nevertheless develop in conjunction with them. The dominance role is played by deergrass, [Scirpus cespitosus], in montane central European bogs, or parts of bogs listed in unit D1.1114. In Atlantic bogs listed in unit D1.1115 it is played by [Erica tetralix]. Somewhat degraded bogs, in particular, bogs affected by anthropozoogenic influences in Atlantic climates, may be overwhelmingly dominated by [Eriophorum vaginatum], usually with complete blurring of the structure. They are listed in unit D1.1116. More severely degraded bogs, invaded by [Molinia caerulea], are listed in unit D1.121. The highly distinctive shrub and sphagnum or shrub and moss hummocks bog expanses of the montane, rapidly dessicating, bogs of the boreal and subarctic zones are listed in unit D1.114 Sphagnum hummocks forming in acidic fens (unit D2.2), transition mires (unit D2.3) or, sometimes, rich fens (unit D4.1), are also indicated by codes of units D1.1111 or D1.1113."

E1.262,5,Middle European [Bromus erectus] semidry grasslands,"Mesophile and meso-xerophile calcareous grasslands of the sub-Atlantic domaine in the Low Countries, Germany, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, northern, central and western France and northwestern Spain. They are faunistically and floristically rich and the highly discontinuous nature of their distribution gives rise to a considerable geographical variation in the composition of plant and animal communities, marked by the occurrence of numerous species of local or disjunct occurrence in addition to the basic cortège common to most of them. Besides this geographical variation, the nature of these grasslands also depends, to a great extent, on hydric regime, substrate characteristics and agropastoral treatment, notably on whether they are mowed or grazed and how intensively. In particular, the relative abundance of the main constituent grass species, [Bromus erectus], [Brachypodium pinnatum] [s. l]., [Sesleria albicans] and [Koeleria pyramidata], varies both geographically with climatic conditions and locally with topography and agropastoral regime. Thus, although separate geographical entities may differ in that relative abundance, similarly differing facies may also coexist locally, producing sharply distinct habitats. To accomodate for these concurrent axes of variation, formations dominated by [Brachypodium] or by [Sesleria], as well as all semidamp formations, are removed from this division and placed in units 34.323, 34.324 and 34.325. Geographical subdivisions, most apt at identifying distinctive plant and animal communities, may be used in the four sections by addition of a fourth decimal digit common to all of them. The regions encompassed by the geographical subdivisions corresponding to each value of this fourth digit are in all cases described under this section although in some of them, or in parts of some of them, there may be no grasslands belonging to unit 34.322, but only grasslands belonging to units 34.323, 34.324 or 34.325; these cases have, as much as possible, been identified under each of the subdivisions below."

Geographical subdivisions are given by level 6 units E1.2621  - E1.262L . [Brachypodium]-dominated facies may form in all the regional types of grasslands inventoried in unit E1.262 as a result of nitrification or of dominance of grazing over mowing.

E6.21,4,Pannonic salt steppes and saltmarshes,"Salt steppes and saltmarsh meadows of the Pannonic plain and its satellite basins. Large expanses of salt steppe form an open landscape of short-grass swards on slightly elevated ground (unit E6.211) and of rills (units E6.213, E6.214), eroded shallow depressions with bare or sparsely vegetated saline soils, dry or moist in spring and prone to white salt efflorescences. Deeper rills, with less ephemeral water, support medium-tall saline meadows (unit E6.212). This unit is represented by the alliance [Beckmannion eruciformis] in the Carpathians and includes small-area fragments. Waterholes that dot the surface harbour brackish aquatic vegetation (unit C1.523) and are fringed by tall emergents (units C3, D5, in particular halophile communities of C3.27); their drying muds, subjected to prolonged immersion, are colonised by pioneer formations of Chenopodiaceae (unit D6.161) or crypsoid grasses (unit E6.23). These ensembles of communities are mainly represented in the central Pannonic plain, east of the Tisza, in the Danube lowlands of the Tisza-Danube interfluve and in the Neusiedler See (Lake Ferto) basin. Smaller relics persist in the Danube lowlands of Slovakia, in the eastern Pannonic plain and Transylvanian basin of Romania, in the Voivodina and have survived until recently in Moravia, where they may now be extinct. Outside of the Pannonic basin, western outposts of the continental salt steppes and saltmarshes (unit E6.2) are also known from the Bohemian basin and from isolated intermontane basins of the southwestern Balkan peninsula; the Bohemian communities have long been extinct; the extremely localized Balkanic ones, although equally related to the Pannonic and Pontic formations, have, for convenience, been includedhere, since they share their extreme western location within the Eurasian salt steppe complex. Species composition depends on two gradients – soil moisture and salination. Important species are [Chenopodium chenopodioides], [Crypsis aculeata], [Spergularia salina], [Scirpus pumilus], [Juncus gerardi] and [Melilotus macrorrhizus]."

X,1,Habitat complexes,The listed habitat complexes represent preliminary draft proposals. They have not been subjected to rigorous scrutiny to ensure consistency. Some complex habitats have been listed above (e.g. valley mires D2.1).
X01,2,Estuaries,"Downstream part of a river valley, subject to the tide and extending from the limit of brackish waters. River estuaries are coastal inlets where there is generally a substantial freshwater influence. The mixing of freshwater and sea water and the reduced current flows in the shelter of the estuary lead to deposition of fine sediments, often forming extensive intertidal sand and mud flats. In addition to herbs, they can also be colonised by shrubs creating thickets (e.g. [Tamarix] spp.). Where the tidal currents are faster than flood tides, most sediments deposit to form a delta at the mouth of the estuary. Baltic river mouths, considered as an estuary subtype, have brackish water and no tide, with helophytic wetland vegetation and luxurious aquatic vegetation in shallow water areas. Littoral and sublittoral habitat types typical of estuaries are included in A2 and A5, although many other habitat types including tidal rivers may occur in estuaries. Includes Transitional waters as defined by the Water Framework Directive."
X02,2,Saline coastal lagoons,"Lagoons are expanses of shallow coastal salt water, of varying salinity and water volume, wholly or partially separated from the sea by sand banks or shingle, or, less frequently, by rocks. Salinity may vary from brackish water to hypersalinity depending on rainfall, evaporation and through the addition of fresh seawater from storms, temporary flooding of the sea in winter or tidal exchange. With or without vegetation of seagrasses or charophytes. Habitat types typical of lagoons are included in A5, although many other habitat types may also occur in lagoons."
X03,2,Brackish coastal lagoons,"Lagoons are expanses of shallow coastal salt water, of varying salinity and water volume, wholly or partially separated from the sea by sand banks or shingle, or, less frequently, by rocks. Fully saline coastal lagoons are classified as X02.
Flads and gloes, considered a Baltic variety of lagoons, are small, usually shallow, more or less delimited water bodies still connected to the sea or cut off from the sea very recently by land upheaval. Characterised by well-developed reedbeds and luxuriant submerged vegetation and having several morphological and botanical development stages in the process whereby sea becomes land. 
Mediterranean lagoons may host the [Ruppietum] community with halophytic vegetation, while at sites with a fresh water supply, plant communities of [Juncetum] and [Phragmitetum] can develop. [Sarcocornia perennis] and [Arthrocnemum macrostachyum] may occur here."
X04,2,Raised bog complexes,"Raised bogs are highly oligotrophic, strongly acidic, domed peatlands, whose peat is composed mainly of sphagnum remains and whose surface derives moisture and nutrients only from rainfall (ombrotrophic).

X07,2,Intensively-farmed crops interspersed with strips of natural and/or semi-natural vegetation,"'Intensively-grown crops interspersed with strips of natural and/or semi-natural vegetation. The semi-natural vegetation, which may consist of ruderal and pioneer species colonising uncultivated land, may be allowed to develop on broad headlands at arable field margins."
X09,2,Pasture woods (with a tree layer overlying pasture),"Pasture woods are the products of historic land management systems, and represent a vegetation structure rather than being a particular plant community. Typically this structure consists of large, open-grown or high forest trees (often pollards) at various densities, in a matrix of grazed grassland, heathland and/or woodland floras. This habitat is most common in southern Britain, but scattered examples occur throughout the UK. Outgrown wood-pasture and mature high forest remnants occur in northern and central Europe, but the number and continuity of ancient (veteran) trees with their associated distinctive saproxylic (wood-eating) fauna and epiphytic flora are more abundant in Britain than elsewhere. Component habitat types include beech and yew woodland (G1.6 and G3.97), heathland (F4) and dry acid grassland (E1.7). A range of native species usually predominates amongst the old trees but there may be non-native species which have been planted or regenerated naturally."
