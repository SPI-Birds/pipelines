\title{Perform a quality check on pipeline outputs}
\usage{
quality_check(
  R_data,
  output = c("both", "errors", "warnings"),
  report = TRUE,
  report_format = c("both", "html", "pdf"),
  report_file = "quality-check-report",
  latex_engine = "lualatex",
  test = FALSE,
  map = TRUE,
  skip = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{R_data}{Output of pipeline as an R object. Generated using
\code{output_type = R} in \code{\link{run_pipelines}}.}

\item{output}{Character. Run checks on and produce report of: potential errors ("errors"), warnings and verified records ("warnings"), or both in separate files ("both"; default).}

\item{report}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a report is produced. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{report_format}{Character. Format of output report: "html", "pdf", or "both" (default).}

\item{report_file}{Character. Name of the output reports. Default: "quality-check-report". Note that to the file name of the report on potential errors the suffix "_errors" is added (i.e. "quality-check-report_errors"), and to the report on warnings and verified records "_warnings" (i.e., "quality-check-report_warnings").}

\item{latex_engine}{Character. LaTeX engine for producing PDF output. Options are "pdflatex", "xelatex", and "lualatex" (default). NB: pdfLaTeX and XeLaTeX have memory limit restrictions, which can be problematic when generating large pdfs. LuaLaTeX has dynamic memory management which may help for generating large pdfs.}

\item{test}{Logical. Is \code{quality_check} being used inside package tests? If  \code{TRUE}, \code{R_data} is ignored and
dummy data will be used instead.}

\item{map}{Logical. If  \code{TRUE}, a map of locations is added in the report. See \code{\link{check_coordinates}}.}

\item{skip}{Character. Identifiers of the individual quality checks (CheckID) that should be skipped.}

\description{
A wrapper function that performs a quality check and produces a report.

\details{
Combines the four data frame-specific wrappers: \code{\link{brood_check}}, \code{\link{capture_check}}, \code{\link{individual_check}} and \code{\link{location_check}}.
