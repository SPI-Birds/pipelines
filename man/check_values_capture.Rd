\usage{
check_values_capture(Capture_data, var, approved_list, output, skip)
}
\arguments{
\item{Capture_data}{Data frame. Capture data output from pipeline.}

\item{var}{Character. Variable to check against reference values.}

\item{approved_list}{List object. List of approved records from brood_approved_list.csv,
capture_approved_list.csv, individual_approved_list.csv, location_approved_list.csv.}

\item{output}{Character. Run checks on potential errors ("errors"), warnings ("warnings"), or both ("both"; default).}

\item{skip}{Character. Identifiers of the individual quality checks (CheckID) that should be skipped.}
}
\value{
A list of:
\item{CheckList}{A summary dataframe of check warnings and errors.}
\item{WarningRows}{A vector of rows with warnings.}
\item{ErrorRows}{A vector of rows with errors.}
\item{Warnings}{A list of row-by-row warnings.}
\item{Errors}{A list of row-by-row errors.}
}
\description{
Check variable values against population-species-specific reference values in capture data. Reference values are based on the data if the number of observations is sufficiently large. Records for population-species combinations that are too low in number are only compared to reference values that are not data generated (see Details below).

Check ID: C1a
\itemize{
\item Adults
\itemize{
\item \emph{n >= 100}\cr
Records are considered impossible if they are negative or larger than 2 times the 99th percentile, and will be flagged as a potential error.
\item \emph{n < 100}\cr
Records are considered impossible if they are negative, and will be flagged as a potential error.
}
\item Chicks
\itemize{
\item Reference values for chicks are calculated for each age (in days). This function tries to fit a logistic growth model to determine reference values to each day. If this model fails, reference values are determined per age if the number of observations is sufficiently large (n >= 100). Records are considered impossible if they are negative or larger than 2 times the 99th percentile, and will be flagged as a potential error.
\item In case the logistic growth model fails and the number of observations for an age are too low (n < 100), records are considered impossible if they are negative, and will be flagged as a potential error.
}
}

\strong{Tarsus}

Check ID: C1b
\itemize{
\item \emph{n >= 100}\cr
Records are considered impossible if they are negative or larger than 2 times the 99th percentile, and will be flagged as a potential error.
\item \emph{n < 100}\cr
Records are considered impossible if they are negative, and will be flagged as a potential error.
}

Note: when the number of observations is too low to generate reference values, a message is added to the list of warnings.
